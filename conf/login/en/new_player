Important Information for New Players
===================================

Before you create your character, please keep the following in mind:

1. Choose your name carefully - you cannot change it later.
2. Your name should:
   - Be fantasy-appropriate
   - Not reference modern culture or celebrities
   - Not be offensive or inappropriate
   - Not be a title (like 'Lord' or 'King')
   - Not impersonate staff members

3. Your password must:
   - Be at least 6 characters long
   - Contain at least one special character
   - Be something you can remember but others cannot guess

If you're ready to proceed, confirm your character name or type 'new'
to choose a different name.

Type 'quit' at any time to exit.
